## About the author

My name is Thomas Schatzl. I work in the HotSpot GC team at Oracle and so Iâ€™ve been contributing to OpenJDK for quite some time. In particular I have been working on garbage collection since 2009.

My main focus during all that times has been improving the G1 garbage collector. 

## About the content

In this blog I would like to talk a bit about my work in the Hotspot garbage collectors. The views in the blog are personal and might not be shared by my employer.
